# av1-avif

This document describes how to use ISO-BMFF structures to generate a HEIF/MIAF
compatible file that contains one or more still images encoded using AV1.

The specification is written using a special syntax (mixing markup and markdown)
to enable generation of cross-references, syntax highlighting, ...
The file using this syntax is index.bs.

index.bs is processed to produce an HTML version (index.html) by a tool
called Bikeshed (https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).

The repository contains both the input and the result of the Bikeshed processing.

Pull requests should contain updates to both files index.html and index.bs, and possibly to other files (Bibliography biblio.json).
