Input image is animals_00 from the Apple test set, rotated to upright (i.e. 180 degrees) and downscaled to 2048x1536 so encoding is faster.

AV1 is encoded using libaom and the following settings:
rc_end_usage = AOM_Q
g_error_resilient = 0
g_lag_in_frames = 0
save_as_annexb = 0

flags = AOM_EFLAG_FORCE_KF
aom_codec_control(codec, AOME_SET_CQ_LEVEL, 12)
aom_codec_control(codec, AV1E_SET_COLOR_RANGE, 1)

Stream is embedded in a HEIF container as a single item.
